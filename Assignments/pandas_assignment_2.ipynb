    "## Grading Rubric\n",
    "\n",
    "Grading overall will be on a 100-point scale. Everyone starts with 100, the final score will be determined based on point deductions related to the overall quality of your code and analysis. The expectation for code is that comments will be included as appropriate, the code is easy to read, efficient, and performs the tasks asked of you. Grading will be more lenient if you attempt more complex code or combinations of code (assuming it makes sense to do so). The analysis will be scored based on proper grammar (spelling, format, composition), and how practical and thoughtful it is. If you have any questions, think about the \"cold reader\" rule, \"Would someone with basic knowledge of this subject matter be able to read through my work in one shot without a lot of questions?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, while collaboration on theory and methods is encouraged, DO NOT share your code line for line with your classmates. Blatant and obvious copying of any parts of your assignment will lead to deductions. This is the time to really develop your individual and analysis styles. \n",
